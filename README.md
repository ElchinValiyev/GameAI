# Game AI Projects

####Notice to all contributors:

A good to very good solution requires additional efforts especially w.r.t. to elegance and readability of your code. If your code is neither commented nor well structured, your solution is not good! A very good solution requires additional efforts towards the quality of your project presentation in the colloquium. Your presentation should be well timed, consistent, and convincing. Striving for very good solutions should always be your goal!

#### How to make slides
1. diagrams, plots, pictures - as beautiful as possible
2. outline
3. style - totally customer-oriented
4. Mari chooses color theme (as guys do not care about such a silly stuff)

#### How to write code
1. user GUI mandatory, as cool as possible
2. give user possibility to push some buttons - let user enter at runtime

#### Project itself, ideas to implement
1. the widest understanding of the task requirements
2. check all the crazy ideas

#### Useful tools
draw.io
plot.ly
