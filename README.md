# Game AI Projects

####Notice to all contributors:

A good to very good solution requires additional efforts especially w.r.t. to elegance and readability of your code. If your code is neither commented nor well structured, your solution is not good! A very good solution requires additional efforts towards the quality of your project presentation in the colloquium. Your presentation should be well timed, consistent, and convincing. Striving for very good solutions should always be your goal!
